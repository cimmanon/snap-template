None of the default Snap templates really suit my purposes.  The default one comes closest, but I find myself making the same modifications to it every time.

* Removes auth snaplet (I don't care for the assumptions made here)
* Adds PostgreSQL Simple snaplet
* Adds Digestive Functors and Digestive Functors Snaplet
* Cabal file is set to development mode by default
